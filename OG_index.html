      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Computer worms are a type of malicious software that exploit network connections between devices 
        to propagate themselves. Unlike other computer viruses, worms do not require user interaction to spread.
        Once a worm infects a device, it takes advantage of vulnerabilities in common network protocols to 
        copy itself to others. Worms have evolved from simple experiments to potent cybersecurity threats that 
        rapidly spread across local networks and the Internet.

      <h2>History of Computer Worms</h2>
      <p>
        Worms were originally created to experiment with the capabilities of large computer networks, 
        but as the Internet grew, so did their sophistication and potential for harm.
      </p>

        <h3>The First Computer Worm: Creeper</h3>
        <p>
          The first instance of a computer worm was named “Creeper,” developed by Bob Thomas of BBN. 
          It was designed as an experiment to see if software could propagate itself across a network 
          without human interaction. The later version by Ray Tomlinson copied itself between devices and 
          displayed the message “I’M THE CREEPER : CATCH ME IF YOU CAN.” 
          Tomlinson also created “Reaper,” which spread through ARPAnet to delete Creeper.

        <ul>
          <li>Developed as a networking experiment, not malicious intent.</li>
          <li>Spread between TENEX systems on ARPAnet.</li>
          <li>Inspired the first antivirus-like software, “Reaper.”</li>

        <h3>The Morris Worm</h3>
        <p>
          The Morris Worm was the first major Internet attack, infecting around 6,000 computers — about 10% 
          of the Internet in 1988. It exploited vulnerabilities in the “sendmail” and “fingerd” programs 
          on Unix systems. Reinfections caused denial of service by overloading system resources. 
          Its creator, Robert Morris, became the first person charged under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

        <ul>
          <li>Caused between $100,000 and $10,000,000 in damages.</li>
          <li>Exploited vulnerabilities in SMTP and buffer overflows.</li>
          <li>Led to U.S. cybersecurity improvements and legal reforms.</li>

        <h3>The Storm Worm Attack</h3>
        <p>
          The Storm Worm of 2007 infected over a million Windows computers. 
          It spread via a spam email titled “230 dead as storm batters Europe,” referencing Cyclone Kyrill. 
          Once infected, machines joined a botnet through peer-to-peer communication and downloaded 
          malicious executables for denial-of-service and remote access. 
          The worm’s packer changed its signature every ten to thirty minutes, making detection difficult.

      <h2>Polymorphic Viruses</h2>
      <p>
        A polymorphic virus is a type of malware that uses cryptography to mutate its code and identifiable 
        characteristics with each infection. The 1990 virus “1260” was the first known instance, using a 
        randomized decryption algorithm to vary its signature and evade antivirus detection.
      </p>
      <article class="property" id="property1">
        <h3>Encryption and Mutation</h3>
        <p>
          Attackers encrypt the payload so it bypasses detection, then decrypt it after installation. 
          Mutation engines randomize aspects such as file name, size, and encryption keys. The code’s structure 
          also changes — variable names and operations are altered, and meaningless “dead code” is inserted.

      <article class="property" id="property2">
        <h3>Heuristic Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          Heuristic analysis detects polymorphic worms by identifying suspicious behaviors and code patterns. 
          It can be static (code comparison) or dynamic (sandbox execution) and is one of the few ways to 
          identify previously unknown or modified malware.

          <li>Static analysis compares decompiled code to known malware.</li>
          <li>Dynamic analysis observes behavior in virtualized environments.</li>

      <article class="property" id="property3">
        <h3>Defensive Strategies</h3>
        <p>
          Defending against polymorphic worms requires multiple layers: regular software updates, 
          network segmentation, automated containment, and endpoint detection. 
          These prevent worms from exploiting system vulnerabilities or spreading between zones.
