      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Computer worms</b> are a class of malicious software that exploit network connections between devices 
        to propagate themselves. Unlike other computer viruses, worms do not require user interaction to spread.
        Once a worm infects a device, it takes advantage of vulnerabilities in common network protocols to 
        copy itself to other devices. Worms have evolved from simple computer networking experiments to 
        potent cybersecurity threats that rapidly spread across local networks and the Internet. A notable
        adaptation in the evolution of worms is <b>polymorphism</b>, where a worm alters its code to evade detection 
        by traditional antivirus software. Information security teams should understand the history and characteristics 
        of polymorphic worms so they can implement effective countermeasures.

      <h2>History of Computer Worms</h2>
      <p>
        Worms were originally created to experiment with the capabilities of large computer networks.
        As the Internet grew, so did the sophistication of worms and their potential for harm.

        <h3>Creeper: The First Computer Worm</h3>
        <p>
          The first instance of a computer worm was named "Creeper," developed by Bob Thomas of Bold, Beranek & N
          Newman (BBN). It was designed as an experiment to see if software could propagate itself across a network 
          without human interaction. A later version of the virus implemented by Ray Tomlinson copied itself between 
          devices and displayed the message "I'M THE CREEPER : CATCH ME IF YOU CAN." Tomlinson also created "Reaper," 
          which spread through ARPAnet to delete instances of the Creeper worm. Reaper is widely considered the first
          antivirus software, though it technically functioned as a worm itself.

        <h3>The Morris Worm: The First Major Internet Attack</h3>
        <p>
          The Morris Worm was the first major Internet attack according to the FBI. Within 24 hours of its release, 
          the worm infected around 6,000 computers which accounted for about 10% of the Internet in 1988. It exploited 
          vulnerabilities in two programs on systems running the Berkely Unix operating system. The first of these is 
          the "sendmail"program in it's implementation of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). The second program is
          the "fingerd" program, which contained a buffer overflow vulnerability that allowed malicious code to be run on
          infected devices. The Morris Worm would reinfect hosts at a high rate, causing denial of service by eating up system 
          resources. The worm's eponymous creator, Robert Morris, was prosecuted by the U.S. government and became the first person 
          charged under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA).

        <h3>The Storm Worm: A Notorious Polymorphic Worm</h3>
        <p>
          The Storm Worm of 2007 infected an estimated 1 million Windows computers at its peak. The virus
          had the properties of a trojan horse (a malicious program disguised as legitimate software) and a worm.
          It spread via a spam email titled "230 dead as storm batters Europe." This spam email referenced the real 
          storm Cyclone Kyrill that was affecting Europe at that present time, enticing users to click the attachment.
          An infected machine would have malicious code injected into the Windows service 'wincom32.sys'. This malicious
          code would allow the machine to be conscripted into a botnet (network of attacker controlled devices) through 
          the peer-to-peer communication of the service. An infected machine could then be activated as a bot, allowing 
          the attacker to control it remotely. Infected bots were controlled to download malicious executables over the 
          Storm network for the purposes of denial-of-service, remote access, and further spreading of the worm. The worm's 
          packer changed the signature every ten to thirty minutes, making detection difficult.

      <h2>Polymorphic Viruses</h2>
      <p>
        A polymorphic virus is a type of malware that uses cryptography to mutate its code and identifiable 
        characteristics upon propagation to new hosts. Polymorphic worms emerged as a response to early commercial
        antivirus software, which relied upon signature-based detection. The signature of a piece of computer software
        can identify a file or the contents inside of it. The first known instance of a polymorphic virus was the ‘1260’ virus, 
        also known as ‘V2PX’, developed by Mark Washburn in 1990. The virus used a randomized decryption algorithm to vary its 
        signature and evade antivirus detection.
      </p>
      <br>
      
      <article class="property" id="property1">
        <h3>Encryption and Mutation</h3>
        <p>
          Attackers encrypt the payload of the malware so that it bypasses detection, then decrypt it after installation. 
          Mutation engines randomize aspects such as file name, type, size, and encryption keys. The malware's code structure 
          also changes — variable names and order of operations are altered, and inconsequential "dead code" is inserted.

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Uses encryption to hide malicious code.</li>
          <li>Alters its signature with each infection, appearing unique to each host.</li>
          <li>Changes the malicious files without changing the function of the malware.</li>
          <li>Evades signature-based antivirus detection.</li>

      <article class="property" id="property2">
        <h3>Heuristic Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          Heuristic analysis detects polymorphic worms by identifying suspicious behaviors across systems, files,
          and networks. This type of detection is adaptable and finds previously unknown or modified viruses that 
          signature-based detection will miss. Heuristic analysis can be static (malware code analysis) or dynamic 
          (malware execution analysis) and is one of the few ways to reliably deal with polymorphic threats and previously 
          unknown malware.

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Static analysis decompiles software and inspects the source code, comparing it with known malware in a heuristic database.</li>
          <li>Dynamic analysis uses a virtual machine to test the malware in an isolated environment.</li>
          <li>Heuristic analysis methods require fine-tuning or they will generate excessive false positives.</li>
        </ul>

      <article class="property" id="property3">
        <h3>Defensive Strategies</h3>
        <p>
          Defending against polymorphic worms requires multiple layers: regular software updates, 
          network segmentation, automated containment, and endpoint detection. The combination of 
          these controls creates defense-in-depth. This approach greatly limits the opportunities 
          for a worm to exploit system vulnerabilities or spread between devices.

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Patch software & operating systems to eliminate vulnerabilities that worms use to spread.</li>
          <li>Divide the network into zones to limit infection spread.</li>
          <li>Use automated isolation solution to contain infections.</li>
          <li>Use endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to discover worms and promptly alert the security team.</li>
